# Sound Wave

## Overview
Sound Wave is a Python script designed to compare and align two signals using cross-correlation techniques. It provides functionality for signal alignment, padding, visualization, and Euclidean distance calculation to quantify signal similarity.

## Features
- Signal Alignment: Align two input signals by maximizing cross-correlation.
- Padding Options: Pad signals with zeros or mean values for equal-length comparison.
- Visualization: Visualize alignment process and results using matplotlib.
- Euclidean Distance: Calculate Euclidean distance between signals for similarity assessment.
- Error Handling: Handle cases where signals are of different lengths.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- librosa
